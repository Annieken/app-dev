## Troll
**The sound that you hear over Oslo when the troll is near is the sound of flight alert or 'Flyalarmen'. It is mostly used to make people known about an coming threat, like a terror attack, a gas leak or an earthquake. This sound is tested twice a year. The last time it was played for real was in Oslo in 2011. It's actually the exact same as the Swedish VMA.**
